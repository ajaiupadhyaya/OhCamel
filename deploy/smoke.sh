# 4. STREAM
#
# Counting frames is not enough. A proxy that buffers still eventually emits
# what it accumulated, so a naive count can pass against a dashboard that is,
# to a human watching it, frozen. What separates streaming from buffering is
# not how many frames arrive but WHEN: a streaming connection spreads them
# across the whole window, a buffered one delivers the pile at once. So this
# records the arrival second of every frame and requires the first and last to
# be meaningfully apart.
#
# On what this assertion actually catches, honestly. Three deliberate proxy
# misconfigurations were tried against it -- flush_interval 30s, gzip applied
# to the stream, and nginx with proxy_buffering on -- and it passed all three,
# because Caddy and nginx both special-case text/event-stream and flush it
# regardless. The buffering scenario is real in principle and hard to provoke
# in practice.
#
# What it does catch, verified by pausing the engine container mid-run: an
# engine that has died, wedged, or stopped ticking. All four assertions in this
# suite failed and the suite exited 1, which is the outcome that matters --
# a deploy must not report success while serving a dashboard that never moves.
# The three distinct failure messages below exist because those three causes
# want different first debugging steps.

# it, because gzip emits blocks -- would pass this suite and fail every real
# visitor. The probe has to ask for what a browser asks for.
