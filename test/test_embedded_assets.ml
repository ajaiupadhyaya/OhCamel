(* The generated modules, and whether the build actually produced them.

   Five modules in lib/ have no source file. dashboard_html.ml, ops_html.ml,
   quoted.ml, crisis_csv.ml and build_info.ml are written by rules in lib/dune
   that concatenate files out of web/ and docs/crisis/, and that puts a whole
   class of failure past the type checker. A rule that cats the wrong file, or
   cats two in the wrong order, or drops one, still produces a `string`, still
   compiles, and still serves: a page with no stylesheet, or a page whose
   <script> arrives before the markup it addresses, is a green build.

   So what is asserted here is STRUCTURE, not content -- that the pieces are
   present and in the order the rule claims. The page itself is not retyped,
   because a test that repeated the page would be a second copy of the page and
   would need editing every time the first one did.

   THE QUOTED CELLS ARE PINS, NOT DERIVATIONS. The `quoted` cases added in a
   later task check numbers transcribed by hand out of README.md. They are
   reproducibility pins in the sense of invariant 7's exception -- values
   captured from a published run and held so a transcription slip is noticed --
   and they are not hand-derived. They do not count among this project's
   hand-derived tests. *)

(* Each marker must occur AFTER the previous one, so the search starts past the
   previous hit rather than at zero. That makes the assertion "these appear in
   this order" rather than "these all appear somewhere", which is the thing a
   reordered (cat ...) actually breaks -- and it is robust to a marker that
   legitimately occurs more than once, as `--ground:` does in the two colour
   schemes. *)
